# 🚀 Google Gemini API Setup Guide

## ✅ **What We've Done**

I've successfully **replaced the problematic KIE AI integration** with **Google's Gemini API (Nano Banana)**! This is much more reliable and uses Google's official image generation service.

## 🔑 **Get Your Google Gemini API Key**

### Step 1: Go to Google AI Studio
Visit: **https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey**

### Step 2: Create API Key
1. Click **"Create API key"**
2. Choose **"Create API key in new project"** (recommended)
3. Copy the generated API key (it starts with `AIza...`)

### Step 3: Add to Railway Environment
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your API key (paste the `AIza...` key)
5. Click **"Add"**
6. Your service will automatically redeploy

## 🎯 **What This Gives You**

✅ **Reliable Authentication**: No more 401 permission errors  
⚡ **Faster Generation**: Synchronous processing (3-5 seconds)  
🎨 **Better Quality**: Google's Nano Banana model for virtual try-on  
💰 **Cost Effective**: $30 per 1M tokens (~$0.03 per image)  
📚 **Official Support**: Google's documented API  

## 🧪 **Testing**

Once you've added the `GEMINI_API_KEY` to Railway:

1. Wait for the deployment to complete (~2 minutes)
2. Try the extension on any clothing website
3. You should now get **real AI-generated try-on images** instead of your uploaded photo!

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

- **API Key Invalid**: Make sure you copied the full key starting with `AIza`
- **Still Getting Fallback**: Check Railway logs to see if the key is detected
- **Generation Fails**: The API key might need billing enabled in Google Cloud

## 📊 **Monitoring Usage**

- Google AI Studio shows your API usage and quotas
- Free tier includes generous limits for testing
- Production usage requires enabling billing

**🎉 Ready to test your new Google Gemini-powered virtual try-on!**
